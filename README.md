# neural-net-project

Shown is an implementation of a neural net eith one hidden layer in python from scratch using the concept of nodes. The code has two separate programs: the training and testing program.
In the training program the training set file and weights are inputted (format later discussed) and the number of epochs and the learning rate are specified. The training program will then generate a file of the learned weights.
In the testing program the program accepts a file of the learned weights, a testing set file, and a file to store all results. The results include the overall accuracy, precision, recall, and f1 score for each class, as well as the micro-averaged and macro-averaged form of these scores.
